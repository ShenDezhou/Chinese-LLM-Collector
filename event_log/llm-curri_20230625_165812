["You are a helpful assistant that tells me the next immediate task to do in Chinese-LLM-Collector. My ultimate goal is to discover as many diverse datasets as possible, acquire as many diverse datasets as possible and become the best Chinese LLM Datasets Collector in the world.\n\nI will give you the following information:\nDownloaded datasets so far: ...\nDownloaded subsets so far: ...\nDownloaded dataset parquets so far: ...\nCompleted tasks so far: ...\nFailed tasks that are too hard: ...\nTask: ...\nDataset: ...\nSubsets: ...\nWorking subset: ...\nSplits: ...\nSplit: ...\n\nYou must follow the following criteria:\n1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next dataset based on my current learning progress.\n2) The next tasks should follow a concise format, such as \"Collect [dataset] [subset] [split]\".\n3) Enumerate all the combination as tasks. [dataset] can select from Dataset information. [subset] can be selected from Subsets information. [split] can be selected from Splits information.\n4) Do remove collected subset tasks. If Downloaded subsets contained the subset, do not include it.\n\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nReasoning: Based on the information provided, you have already collected the clue afqmc dataset.\nTask: Collect clue tnews train.\nTask: Collect clue tnews validation.\nTask: Collect clue tnews test.\nTask: Collect clue iflytek train.\nTask: Collect clue iflytek validation.\nTask: Collect clue iflytek test.\n...", "\nDownloaded datasets so far: c3, clue, dicache, lccc\n\nDownloaded subsets so far: c3/mixed, clue/tnews, clue/afqmc, dicache/the, dicache/the/dataset_infos.json, dicache/lccc, dicache/lccc/dataset_infos.json, dicache/clue, dicache/clue/dataset_infos.json, dicache/c3, dicache/c3/dataset_infos.json, lccc/base\n\nDownloaded dataset parquets so far: c3/mixed/c3-test.parquet, clue/tnews/clue-validation.parquet, clue/tnews/clue-train.parquet, clue/tnews/clue-test.parquet, clue/afqmc/clue-validation.parquet, clue/afqmc/clue-train.parquet, clue/afqmc/clue-test.parquet, lccc/base/lccc-test.parquet\n\nCompleted tasks so far: Collect clue afqmc train, Collect clue afqmc validation, Collect clue afqmc test\n\n\nFailed tasks that are too hard: None\n\n\nTask: clue afqmc train\nDataset: clue\nSubsets: afqmc, tnews, iflytek, cmnli, cluewsc2020, csl, cmrc2018, drcd, chid, c3, ocnli, diagnostics\nWorking subset: afqmc\nSplits: Train, Validation, Test\nSplit: train\n\n", "Reasoning: Based on the information provided, you have already collected the clue afqmc dataset.\n\nTask: Collect clue tnews train.\nTask: Collect clue tnews validation.\nTask: Collect clue tnews test.\nTask: Collect clue iflytek train.\nTask: Collect clue iflytek validation.\nTask: Collect clue iflytek test.\nTask: Collect clue cmnli train.\nTask: Collect clue cmnli validation.\nTask: Collect clue cmnli test.\nTask: Collect clue cluewsc2020 train.\nTask: Collect clue cluewsc2020 validation.\nTask: Collect clue cluewsc2020 test.\nTask: Collect clue csl train.\nTask: Collect clue csl validation.\nTask: Collect clue csl test.\nTask: Collect clue cmrc2018 train.\nTask: Collect clue cmrc2018 validation.\nTask: Collect clue cmrc2018 test.\nTask: Collect clue drcd train.\nTask: Collect clue drcd validation.\nTask: Collect clue drcd test.\nTask: Collect clue chid train.\nTask: Collect clue chid validation.\nTask: Collect clue chid test.\nTask: Collect clue c3 train.\nTask: Collect clue c3 validation.\nTask: Collect clue c3 test.\nTask: Collect clue ocnli train.\nTask: Collect clue ocnli validation.\nTask: Collect clue ocnli test.\nTask: Collect clue diagnostics train.\nTask: Collect clue diagnostics validation.\nTask: Collect clue diagnostics test."]
